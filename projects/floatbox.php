	<p class="description">This was a project from my time at Yoobee School of Design in which me and 2 others were required to create a portfolio website for a design agency. This website had to use the Behance API to pull and display data of the agencies team members. Instead of using an existing design agency we decided to create our own. I was responsible for the brand identity and also most of the development side.</p>
